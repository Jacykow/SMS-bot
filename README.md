## SMSbot

#### To make it work you need to:
- Prepare a list of phone numbers to send the message to, each in one line.
- Enable USB debugging on your phone (google this for your own device)
- Install adb and make it accesible anywhere, which is explained in [this youtube video](https://www.google.com).

#### MMS
To send anything apart from text (e.g. a picture) you can read the comments in the .cpp file and just code it yourself.
